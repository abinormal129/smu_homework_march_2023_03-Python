In the PyBank and PyPoll homework exercises, we were provided with corresponding csv files. The tasks included importing and reading in to Python the appropriate csv file for each activity, then performing various analysis and summarizations on the data. In each Submission folder, PyBank and PyPoll, you will find three files: the csv resource file (please note, the csv for the PyPoll exercise is an especially large dataset), the Python code, and a text file containing the results printed from the Python code.

In PyBank, summary information and analysis tracked profits and losses over a period of 86 months, the average change over that course of time, and both the greatest increase and decrease in profits across those 86 months. When the Python code is run, the summary and calculations are completed and returned on screen, as well as printed out to the accompanying text file. Looking over the analysis, it would seem that the financial institution in question is losing close to $10K every month on average.

The PyPoll activity differed in that the data was a large set of voter information, so the summary and analysis focused on candidates, number of votes, and a winner based on popular vote. However, like the PyBank activity, the Python code also returns the results on screen, as well as to an accompanying text file. In terms of interpreting said results, we see that the data contained over 350,000 votes, and candidate Diana DeGette was the clear winner by a significant margin.

Interestingly, doing this Python homework during the week of learning about Pandas sheds light onto how much effort and time Pandas can save in some cases... maybe most cases, even!
